MicroSpace Shooter
--------------------------------------
+ Unity Version Used: 2020.3.41f1
+ Target: PC, Mac
+ Game Type: Shooter
+ Theme: Sci-Fi
+ 3D/2D: 3D 


Development Known Issues
**************************************
+ If you use Random laser speed attribute when create the Scriptable object for a turret, there's a slightly chance that the laser becomes unavoidable for the player, this is affected depending on the device is played
+ Drag movement must be improved in android devices, I tried to to it by myself without using any script asset from the marketplace.
+ Camera movement while following the player sometimes get weird rotations and collisions
+ The idea is using LCtrl and LAlt to change weapons, however they don't loop the weapons and after you reach any of the ends it stays there. (Not really an Issue but is something that might be improved)
